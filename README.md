My name is Anthony Graves-McCleary. 
I'm a fifth year math Ph.D. student at Cornell University.
My advisor is Laurent Saloff-Coste.
This GitHub page is a repository of some my data science projects at the Erdos Data Science Boot Camp and in graduate machine learning courses at Cornell (Fall '22 and Spring '23).
Welcome!
